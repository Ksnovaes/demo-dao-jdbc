# My Second project in Java - DAO (Data Access Object) JDBC 

This is my second project done in Java, you can notice that I have progressed a bit in the language since my first project (chess system). This project is more about learning how JDBC works and also DAO.
I am glad to see that I am advancing more and more in my projects.

###### I confess that I found this project now easier than the first one because the first one involved a lot of logic, but with a bit of study, you start to understand more clearly.
